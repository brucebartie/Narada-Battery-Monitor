This is a C# project. Using a RS485 to USB converter you can display all the information in your Narada battery bank. 
This will give you a better idea of how each battery is doing.
My current Inverter does not read these batteriews correctly and the information of their state and activities cannot be viewed.
Long term i want this program to send a data packet to the inverter, so that it can display 
the SOC, charge/discharge rate and correclty, and also use that to charge/discharge the 
batteries safely and correctly.
